# Next.js Authentication Practice

This is a learning project built with Next.js to practice implementing authentication using Auth.js and database operations with Drizzle ORM.

## About This Project

I created this repository as a hands-on way to explore Authjs and improve my skills. It's meant to be a collaborative learning space where we can grow together.

## Join the Learning Journey

If you're also interested in learning about these technologies or have knowledge to share:

- Star the repo if you find it useful
- Open an issue for questions or suggestions
- Submit PRs to improve the codebase or add new features

Let's learn together! All skill levels are welcome.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Pending Features

## User Experience Improvements

- [ ] Add loading spinners on register/login buttons when waiting for results
- [ ] Implement field-specific error messages in the login form
- [ ] Add OAuth login support
- [ ] Implement password reset throttling (including UI and backend)

## Component Reusability

- [ ] Create reusable components for update/modify operations
- [ ] Develop reusable message popup components for displaying operation statuses (e.g., "Password updated successfully")

## Function Testing

- [ ] authorize function in auth.ts, check if return {error:true} work properly;
- [ ] handle different errors that happens in the auth.ts file;

## Note

These features will be implemented gradually. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
